Data Visualization Project: Riots and Protests in India (2016–2022)

This repository contains a data visualization project that examines patterns of riots and protests across India from 2016 to 2022. 
The purpose of this project is to understand how incidents have changed over time, identify regional variations, and present insights through clear and meaningful visualizations.

The project uses Python-based visualization libraries to explore trends in public unrest, highlight geographical distributions,and present data through interactive and static charts.
Project Overview

The dataset includes information on different categories of riots and protests recorded across states and districts of India. The project focuses on:

Annual comparisons
State-wise and region-wise variations
Types of protests and their frequency
Geographical hotspots
Patterns visible over the seven-year timeline
All visualizations are created to help the viewer understand the scale, distribution, and evolution of public unrest during the given period.

Objectives
To clean, prepare, and understand the dataset
To explore patterns and trends using visual tools
To present the findings in the form of charts, plots, and maps
To demonstrate proficiency in visualization libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, and Plotly
To provide a structured and easy-to-read notebook that explains every step
Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Folium for maps
Plotly for interactive charts
Jupyter Notebook

Visualizations Included
The notebooks contain the following types of visualizations:
Line plots showing trends from 2016 to 2022
Bar charts for category-wise and state-wise comparisons
Heatmaps showing correlations
Choropleth maps of India indicating regional intensity
Interactive maps and plots for deeper exploration
Distribution plots to show frequency patterns
Comparative visuals between years and states

Purpose of This Project

This project is made for academic learning and to demonstrate skills in:
Data cleaning
